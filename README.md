Summary table of arthropod communities is included here as arthropoda1.csv. In that file, there are the following columns (variables):

ID = pitfall sequential ID number

SITE = study site

LAND	= land managmenet treatment, either inside the protected areas or outside

ENCLOSURE	= grazing exclusion treatment: currently grazed, recently ungrazed, long-time ungrazed

PLOT	= plot number

BLOCK	= block number

REPLICATION	= time replicate

CLASS	= arthropod class name

ORDER	= artrhopod order name

FAMILY	= arthropod family name

INDIVIDUALS	= number of specimens

stage	= life-history stage

Notes

The second dataset art2.csv contains the summary table formatted for statistical analysis. In there, each row is a replicated experimental unit (i.e., one pitfall in each treatment combination in each sampling time).
